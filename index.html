          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a driven individual who embarked on a transformative journey
            from the hospitality industry to the realm of technology. With six
            years of experience in hospitality under my belt, I made the bold
            decision to pursue my passion for coding. I embarked on a part-time
            study journey, financing my own coding bootcamp to transition into a
            full stack web developer role. Prior to this, I studied sport and
            fitness at Northlink College, earning a diploma in the field.
            Currently employed as a junior web developer in fintech, I thrive on
            challenges, embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth. Despite
            being in the early stages of my career, my tenacity shines through
            as I fearlessly tackle highly complex tasks, always striving to
            grasp the fundamentals.

          <h2>Hands-On Experience</h2>
          <p>
            During my tenure, I spearheaded the development of a Vue.js
            replication of our company's WordPress website, employing Vuetify
            for comprehensive styling and incorporating external dependencies
            like axios for streamlined sign-up form requests. This project
            culminated in successful deployment to Firebase via GitHub and
            subsequently to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Concurrently, I led a
            separate initiative to construct an internal service desk and
            ticketing system using Vue.js for the frontend, Node.js for backend
            functionality, and initially MySQL for data management. However, due
            to specific deployment requirements, we transitioned to MongoDB, a
            non-relational database. Despite the primary WordPress site
            remaining operational, the Vue.js site underwent rigorous testing.
            Additionally, I undertook responsibilities such as managing internal
            reporting via Google Sheets, executing mass payments across various
            systems, and orchestrating API calls with XML and JSON responses.
            These experiences underscore my adeptness in frontend and backend
            development, as well as my proficiency in navigating diverse
            technological landscapes to meet organizational needs.
